# Vale Agent Build Guide

> Mirrors agent/AGENTS.md (build/verify/architecture semantics must stay
> identical; the stage-n living log lives ONLY in agent/AGENTS.md — this
> file never mirrors it). agent/AGENTS.md additionally
> carries the stage-n iteration log maintained by the DSH loop.

## Cross-compilation to Windows (MSVC)

Requires `cargo-xwin` for cross-compiling from Linux:

```bash
# Install
cargo install cargo-xwin

# Windows check (fast, run after touching Cargo.toml or feature-gated code)
cargo xwin check -p vale-agent --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --features terminal,keyring

# Debug build
cargo clean && cargo xwin build -p vale-agent --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --features terminal,keyring

# Release build
cargo clean && cargo xwin build -p vale-agent --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --features terminal,keyring --release
```

Output binaries:
- `target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/debug/vale-agent.exe` (debug)
- `target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/vale-agent.exe` (release)

`scripts/build.sh agent` cross-compiles vale-agent (the retired tray/Tauri
desktop builds were removed round-330).

## Install / update — npm is THE single channel

- `vale setup` = PURE LOCAL install (no key/tunnel/cloud). `--reg-key <key>`
  and `--tunnel <host>` are OPTIONAL extras; the Settings page Gateway card
  (`POST /api/gateway/connect`) is the GUI way to configure them.
- Install layout is registry-first: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Vale\Agent\{InstallDir,DataDir}`
  — all path resolution goes through `src/paths.rs` (`install_dir()`/`data_dir()`);
  zero `current_exe()` guesses outside it, zero legacy-directory probing.
- Boxed components: `vale-playwright.zip` → `InstallDir\playwright\`,
  `cloudflared.exe` → `InstallDir\tools\` (agent-supervised, no Windows service).
- The NSIS installer / setup.ps1 / run-setup.bat are RETIRED
  (`deploy/retired/`).

## Device update — npm one-click update (THE ONLY sanctioned rollout path)

**Always ship device updates through the npm flow. Never hand-roll
kill/copy/restart scripts over a terminal PTY** — the PTY is hosted by the
agent itself, so an inline `Stop-Process` kills your own shell before the
restart command runs and leaves the device dark (happened twice on d1).

Release + rollout:

```bash
# 1. Build the exe (panel changes must be built BEFORE this — panel.js is
#    embedded at compile time via include_str!):
cd resources/panel-react && npm run build && npm test && cd ../..
cargo xwin build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --release --features terminal,keyring --bin vale-agent

# 2. Stage artifacts into the npm package and bump its version:
cp target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/vale-agent.exe vale-agent-npm/vale-agent.exe
# then bump "version" in vale-agent-npm/package.json (1.2.x)
# (bridge.js was removed in round-263 — the npm package ships no bridge)
cd vale-agent-npm && npm pack          # → vale-agent-1.2.N.tgz

# 3. Publish: stage the tgz into the dist worker assets (ALSO the
#    versionless latest alias + the version.json discovery manifest)
#    and deploy them (or run scripts/publish-release.sh <ver>, which wraps
#    pack + stage + alias + manifest + last-5 prune + commit + deploy):
cp vale-agent-1.2.N.tgz ../../index/public/vale-agent/
cp vale-agent-1.2.N.tgz ../../index/public/vale-agent/vale-agent-latest.tgz
# version.json MUST carry the tgz sha256 — /api/version requires ver && sha
# (else it answers 503 and agent_update refuses the install, round-119):
SHA=$(sha256sum vale-agent-1.2.N.tgz | cut -d' ' -f1)
printf '{"version":"1.2.N","tarball":"vale-agent-latest.tgz","updated":"%s","sha256":"%s"}\n' "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" "$SHA" > ../../index/public/vale-agent/version.json
cd ../../index && CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.cloudflare-token) npx wrangler deploy

# 4. On the device (PowerShell), exactly two commands:
npm i -g https://agent.saisi.online/vale-agent/vale-agent-latest.tgz   (or pin the version)
vale update
```

# 5. GitHub Release = CI (release.yml rewrite): after the version-bump
# commit is pushed, create the tag ON GITHUB VIA THE API — direct git
# push of tags intermittently times out on this network; the API is
# reliable, and the tag-push event triggers the workflow (panel build →
# xwin exe → npm pack → gh release create --verify-tag). package.json
# version MUST equal the tag; mismatch fails fast. keep-latest: delete
# the previous release AND older tag refs manually (API, /git/refs/tags/
# <tag> — the URL needs the full refs path, not just the name).

What `vale update` does (bin/vale.js): stages the exe (and desktop shell
sources) next to the install dir, hands a PS swap script to WMI
Win32_Process.Create (parented by
WmiPrvSE so it survives the CLI AND the agent dying; plain `-NoProfile -File`
only — `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` / `-EncodedCommand` die silently on d1),
then: stop ValeAgent task → kill agent
tree → copy with retry → restart task. The terminal connection DROPS for ~10 s mid-update; reconnect
and verify via `/api/status` → `version`.

Gateway (`gateway/`) deploys separately: `cd gateway && wrangler deploy`.

## Architecture

vale-agent is a pure service — MCP server + terminal backends + SSE endpoints
+ the Electron desktop shell (embedded real browser on CDP 9333). The Tauri desktop (`vale-desktop/`), the
standalone `vale-tray/`, and the NSIS-era installers are RETIRED; the Electron
shell (`vale-desktop-electron/`) and the gateway device app replaced them. The
web panel (`/panel`, Apple-style terminal) is served by `src/web.rs` — token
entered in the browser, kept in localStorage (no server-side injection since
1.0.5).

- **MCP** (rmcp): served at `/mcp` ON THE MAIN AGENT PORT (default 18080,
  same HTTP surface) — token-gated via `TokenGate` in `src/web.rs` (rmcp has
  no server-side auth hook). There is no separate port 3000 any more.

### Module map

```
src/
  main.rs          server binary (config path as argv[1]); Windows service
                   mode via windows-service when launched by the SCM
  lib.rs           crate root; DEFAULT_CONFIG_YAML embedded (include_str!)
  bootstrap.rs     vale_command::bootstrap::load_or_create(path, fallback) —
                   create-if-missing, load, ensure_token. Single bootstrap site.
  metrics.rs       device vitals for /api/status (CPU delta + memory, kernel32)
  filelog.rs       size-rotating tracing writer -> agent.log next to the exe
  session_log.rs   per-session JSONL audit log (trim-on-close + 30 d retention)
  state.rs         AppState { serial_pool, terminal_mgr, event_bus,
                   plugin_registry, config } — managers are Arc<Manager>,
                   managers own their locks internally (only config_path
                   carries a small std Mutex inside AppState)
  mcp/server.rs    DeviceServer (rmcp ServerHandler), bind() -> (addr, handle)
                   (port 0 = ephemeral, used by tests), serve_with_token
  web.rs           HTTP surface — hand-rolled Tower service (NOT axum route
                   handlers: they break Windows cross-compilation). TokenGate<S>
                   wraps the /mcp route with the bearer check. Routes:
                   GET / (minimal status page), /api/status, /api/spec,
                   /api/events (SSE), /api/events/poll, /api/events/term (SSE),
                   POST /api/tools/{name}, GET /api/plugins/status,
                   GET/PUT /api/settings (buffer_mb + console_url),
                   POST /api/gateway/connect (Settings-page Gateway card:
                   persist console_url, reg-key → CF token exchange, optional
                   free tunnel via provision_tunnel),
                   GET /api/browser/{pwshots,pwshot,actions} (AI evidence —
                   the pwout screenshots/action feed), GET /api/sessions
                   (audit list)
  plugins/         PluginRegistry (tools cached once at register); terminal/
                   mod.rs (plugin struct + shared helpers) + tools.rs (one
                   builder fn per tool)
  tools/           terminal/ (TerminalManager + TermBackend trait; pty.rs,
                   ssh.rs, serial.rs, secrets.rs, stub.rs), serial.rs, ssh.rs
vale-command-core/      Plugin/ToolDef/ToolHandler/NavItem, Config (+ensure_token via
                   getrandom), DeviceError (typed variants), EventBus/AppEventBus
(vale-tray/ and vale-desktop/ Tauri source deleted round-330 — both
 retired; the npm CLI + Electron shell replaced them.)

## Conventions

- **Commit style**: conventional commits with stage tags (`fix(stage-g)`,
  `refactor(stage-i)`, `perf(stage-h)`, `feat(stage-k)` …). Each commit must
  leave the workspace green.
- **Verification per change**: `cargo test` → `cargo clippy --all-targets
  -- -D warnings` (round-301: CI promotes EVERY warning — mirror CI exactly;
  grep ^error misses warnings CI fails on) → `cargo xwin check -p vale-agent
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --features terminal,keyring`. After touching
  feature-gated code, also run `cargo test --features terminal,keyring` and
  `cargo clippy --features terminal,keyring --all-targets -- -D warnings`. Smoke:
  `cargo run --bin vale-agent --features terminal,keyring -- /tmp/ct.yaml`
  then curl `/api/status` and `/api/tools/terminal_list` with the Bearer token
  from `/tmp/ct.yaml`.
- **Feature-gating rule**: real terminal code is gated behind the `terminal`
  feature (PTY/SSH/serial); secrets behind `keyring`. The boundary lives only
  in the `#[cfg]` mod declarations and re-export lines (`pub use desktop_impl::X` /
  `pub use stub_impl::X`). Public paths must stay identical across configs so
  headless tests exercise the full dispatch path against the stubs.
- **Locks**: managers own their locks internally (tokio Mutex on Inner).
  Callers hold `Arc<Manager>` and never `.lock()`. Poison recovery:
  `unwrap_or_else(|p| p.into_inner())` — never silently drop data.
- **Channels**: output bounded with backpressure (blocking_send in reader
  threads); keystrokes try_send drop-on-full.
- **MCP tool additions**: define the tool in `src/plugins/<plugin>/tools.rs`;
  the registry caches it at register time — no other registration site.
  Update the tool-count test in plugins/terminal/mod.rs (26 tools:
  22 terminal_* incl. env/jobs/saved/connect/forget + secret_* legacy aliases)
  if adding/removing terminal tools; the plugin tests in
  plugins/{memory,system,mcp_client}/mod.rs cover their own counts.

## Device memory + desktop shell

- **memory plugin** (`src/plugins/memory/`): device-local knowledge base shared
  across AI clients — 6 MCP tools (`memory_save/search/list/update/delete/
  export`). JSONL + in-memory index at `<install>/memory/memory.jsonl`, soft
  delete, LRU capacity from config `memory: { max_entries, max_bytes,
  retention_days }`, credential sanitizer (`sanitize.rs`). Lives at
  `data_dir()/memory` (registry-first `DataDir`), NOT under InstallDir.
- **stdio transport (no port)**: `mcp_client_connect` defaults to
  `transport=stdio` — the bundled playwright-mcp is spawned over stdin/stdout
  (newline-JSON frames, rmcp `TokioChildProcess`), NO listening port.
  `transport=http` (9229) remains for external servers. Test override:
  `VALE_TEST_STDIO_NODE` / `VALE_TEST_STDIO_ENTRY` (see
  `tests/mcp_stdio_integration.rs`).
- **saisi decouple**: `config.yaml platform.console_url/download_url` are
  OPTIONAL — unset means a purely local install; `agent_update` and
  `page_view` remote pages error explicitly, device self-register skips.
- **desktop shell**: `vale-desktop-electron/` (Electron) loads
  `http://127.0.0.1:18080/desktop/` — the same SPA in desktop mode (terminal/
  browser/memory/plugins/settings rail). Owns CDP 9333 for AI driving, a tray
  with health + vitals, a 60 s AGENT WATCHDOG (`schtasks /run ValeAgent`), and
  a wait page that reappears when the agent dies mid-session. `/desktop/`
  reuses `/panel/` assets + loopback token injection (web.rs).
  round-274: main.ts sets backgroundThrottling:false + the
  --disable-renderer-backgrounding / --disable-backgrounding-occluded-
  windows switches — a hidden window (hide-to-tray / background session)
  otherwise flips the SPA to visibilityState=hidden, Chromium stops
  requestAnimationFrame, and xterm's rAF-driven DOM renderer silently
  stops painting (blank terminals while the AI keeps operating).

## vale-tray / vale-desktop (Tauri) — DELETED (round-330)

Both crates retired (npm CLI replaced the tray; Electron shell replaced
the Tauri desktop); source + builds removed round-330 — git history
retains them. The npm CLI (`vale` from `vale-agent-npm/bin/vale.js`) is
the management surface.

## Windows smoke checklist (manual)

Terminal: open pty (PowerShell), type + resize, ssh + serial sessions, saved
connections + keychain password. MCP: `claude` direct device MCP
(`https://dN.../mcp`) and `/api/tools/terminal_list` with the Bearer token.
Events: `/api/events` SSE + `/api/events/term` stream. Electron shell:
tray shows health + vitals, 60 s watchdog recovers a dead agent, wait page
reappears when the agent dies; desktop SPA mirrors the panel (CDP :9333
drives the same view). Gateway card: `POST /api/gateway/connect` registers
console URL + key from the Settings page. `/api/status` reports the npm
release (not the Cargo version).
